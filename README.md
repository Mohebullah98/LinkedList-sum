# LinkedList-sum
Compute sum of two Linked Lists into a 3rd Linked List

You have two numbers represented by Linked Lists in reverse where each node is a single digit.
Write a function that adds two numbers and returns the sum as a linked list.

ex: input(7,1,6) + (5,9,2) = 617 + 295
    Output: (9,1,2) =912
